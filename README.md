## üîß How It Works

### Architecture Overview

BlockVista Terminal operates on a hybrid architecture that combines traditional web application frameworks with blockchain technology. The system is designed with three core layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: User-facing web interface built with modern frontend technologies
2. **Application Layer**: Business logic, API endpoints, and service orchestration
3. **Blockchain Layer**: Distributed ledger for trade verification and data immutability

### Data Flow

1. **Market Data Ingestion**: Real-time market data is received from exchange APIs and data providers
2. **Processing & Validation**: Incoming data is validated, normalized, and processed through analytics engines
3. **Blockchain Recording**: Critical transactions and trade signals are hashed and added to the blockchain
4. **User Interaction**: Processed data and analysis results are presented through the web interface
5. **Trade Execution**: User orders are validated, executed, and recorded on the blockchain for auditability

### Blockchain Mechanism

The application implements a permissioned blockchain where:

- **Block Creation**: Each block contains a batch of trades/transactions with timestamp and hash
- **Proof of Work**: Mining mechanism ensures computational verification of each block
- **Chain Validation**: Continuous validation of blockchain integrity through hash verification
- **Consensus**: Multi-node verification ensures data accuracy and prevents tampering
- **Merkle Trees**: Efficient verification of large transaction sets

### Security Model

Security is implemented at multiple levels:

- **Transport Layer**: HTTPS/TLS encryption for all network communications
- **Application Layer**: Session management, input validation, and CSRF protection
- **Data Layer**: Encrypted storage with blockchain immutability
- **Authentication Layer**: JWT tokens with expiration and refresh mechanisms
